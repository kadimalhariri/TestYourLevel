    <h2>Section 1: General Awareness</h2>

    <h3>Web Development Basics:</h3>

    <p>
      Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications.
      It encompasses everything from building the structure and layout of a
      website to adding interactivity and functionality. In today's
      internet-driven world, web development is essential because it allows
      businesses and individuals to establish a presence online, share
      information, and connect with a global audience.
    </p>

    <h3>HTML Knowledge:</h3>

    <p>
      Yes, I have heard of HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It's
      the foundation of web pages, providing the structure and content. HTML
      uses tags to define different elements like headings, paragraphs, images,
      and links.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 2: Familiarity with CSS</h2>

    <h3>CSS Understanding:</h3>

    <p>
      Yes, I am familiar with CSS. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It's
      responsible for the visual presentation of a web page. Using CSS,
      developers control the layout, colors, fonts, and overall aesthetics of a
      website, transforming the basic structure of HTML into a visually
      appealing and user-friendly experience.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 3: JavaScript and Its Importance</h2>

    <h3>Introduction to JavaScript:</h3>

    <p>
      Yes, I have heard of JavaScript. JavaScript is a programming language that
      adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows elements
      to respond to user actions, create animations, and communicate with
      servers to update content without reloading the entire page. JavaScript is
      crucial for building modern, engaging websites that go beyond static
      content.
    </p>

    <h2>Section 4: Introduction to React and Node.js</h2>

    <h3>React and Node.js Awareness:</h3>

    <p>
      Yes, I am familiar with React and Node.js. Here's a brief explanation of
      their roles:
    </p>

    <p>
      React: React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It uses
      a component-based approach, making it easier to manage complex interfaces
      and ensuring code reusability. React is popular for creating dynamic and
      interactive web applications. Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment
      that allows developers to use JavaScript on the server-side. This enables
      building web applications where the server can handle complex logic and
      communicate with databases, ultimately delivering a more seamless user
      experience.
    </p>
    <h2>Section 5: Bonus Question</h2>

    <h3>Learning Intentions:</h3>

    <p>
      I am interested in learning web development because it opens doors to a
      vast and creative field. Mastering the fundamentals like HTML, CSS, and
      JavaScript will provide a strong foundation for building interactive
      websites. Understanding frameworks like React and Node.js will equip me to
      create modern, scalable web applications. Ultimately, I hope to leverage
      these skills to bring ideas to life, contribute to meaningful projects,
      and potentially build a career in web development.
